<objective>
Add social links (GitHub, LinkedIn) to the Navbar, update placeholder URLs with real values, and verify existing contact functionality still works.

Purpose: Completes the navigation requirements (CONT-04, CONT-05) and verifies contact features (CNCT-01, CNCT-02) still function. After this plan, all Phase 3 success criteria are met.

Output: Navbar with social icons, real social URLs throughout, verified contact form.

  <name>Task 1: Collect real GitHub and LinkedIn URLs</name>
  <decision>What are your GitHub and LinkedIn profile URLs?</decision>
  <context>
The data store currently has placeholder values:
- GitHub: `https://github.com/yourusername`
- LinkedIn: `https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername`
- Site URL: `https://yourportfolio.com`

These need to be replaced with real URLs before proceeding. The email `Mackenzie.barry@icloud.com` is already correct.

Additionally, the About section bio was enhanced in Plan 01. Please confirm if the bio content is acceptable or provide preferred text.

  <name>Task 2: Update data store with real URLs and add social icons to Navbar</name>
  <files>src/data/index.ts, src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Part A: Update `src/data/index.ts`**

Replace placeholder values in the `navigation.social` array with the real URLs provided by the user in Task 1:
- GitHub href: user-provided GitHub URL
- LinkedIn href: user-provided LinkedIn URL
- Email href: already correct (`mailto:Mackenzie.barry@icloud.com`)

Also update `siteConfig.url` if the user provided their real portfolio URL. If not provided, leave as-is (will be addressed in Phase 5 SEO).

Do NOT modify the `about`, `hero`, `contact`, `footer`, or `projects` exports.

**Part B: Add social icons to `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`**

Add GitHub and LinkedIn icon links to the desktop navigation area. Import `Github` and `Linkedin` from lucide-react (already available in the project).

In the desktop nav section (the `hidden md:flex items-center gap-8` div), add social icons AFTER the main navigation links but BEFORE the ThemeToggle. Filter to show only GitHub and LinkedIn (not Email -- email is in Contact section).

For each social link:
```tsx
<a
  key={social.name}
  href={social.href}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground transition-colors"
  aria-label={social.name}
>
  <Icon className="w-4 h-4" />
</a>
```

Use the same icon resolution pattern from Footer.tsx to map the `icon` string to the component.

Add a subtle `|` separator or `border-l border-border h-4` divider between the main nav links and the social icons to visually separate them.

For mobile menu: Add GitHub and LinkedIn links at the bottom of the mobile menu dropdown, using the same icon + text pattern. Use `flex gap-4` horizontal layout to save vertical space.

Do NOT change the existing navigation link structure, mobile menu open/close logic, or scroll handling. Do NOT remove the ThemeToggle.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx next build` to confirm build succeeds. Run `npx next dev` and verify:
1. Desktop navbar shows GitHub and LinkedIn icons that open correct profiles in new tabs
2. Mobile menu shows social links
3. Footer social links also point to correct (non-placeholder) URLs
4. All existing nav links (Home, Projects, About, Contact) still work
5. Contact form still renders and the email link in Contact section is visible
  </verify>
  <done>
Navbar displays GitHub and LinkedIn icon links (desktop: icons only with aria-labels, mobile: icons in menu). All social links use real URLs provided by the user. Links open in new tabs with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. Footer social links automatically updated (reads same data store). Contact form and email link confirmed functional. Build succeeds.
  </done>
