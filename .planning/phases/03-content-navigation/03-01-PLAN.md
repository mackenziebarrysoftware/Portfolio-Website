<objective>
Enrich the About section with professional content (bio, availability status, Belfast location with timezone) and fix scroll navigation offset for the fixed navbar.

Purpose: Delivers the core content requirements (CONT-01, CONT-02, CONT-03, CONT-05 partial) so the About section communicates professional identity, freelance availability, and location to potential clients. Also fixes the scroll offset issue so navigation works correctly across all sections.

Output: Enhanced About section with availability badge, location/timezone info, improved bio, and correct scroll-to-section behavior.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extend data store with availability, location, and enhanced bio</name>
  <files>src/data/index.ts</files>
  <action>
Extend the existing `about` export in `src/data/index.ts` with two new properties: `availability` and `location`. Do NOT modify the existing `skills` or `experience` fields.

Add to the `about` object:

```typescript
availability: {
  status: 'available' as const,
  message: 'Available for freelance projects',
},
location: {
  city: 'Belfast',
  country: 'Northern Ireland',
  timezone: 'GMT/BST (UTC+0/+1)',
},
```

Also update the `bio` field from the current generic student text to something more compelling for freelance clients. The bio should mention: Software Engineering student at Lancaster University (MEng, 2024-2028), based in Belfast, builds web applications with React/Next.js/TypeScript, available for freelance work. Keep it 2-3 sentences, professional but approachable.

Additionally, add `scroll-margin-top: 6rem` to `src/app/globals.css` inside the existing `@layer base` block, targeting `section[id]`. This accounts for the fixed Navbar height (h-20 = 5rem) plus 1rem breathing room. The `scroll-behavior: smooth` is already configured in globals.css on the `html` element.

Important: Do NOT modify the `navigation`, `hero`, `contact`, `footer`, `siteConfig`, or `projects` exports. Only modify the `about` export and globals.css.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm TypeScript compiles without errors. Verify the about object still exports correctly by checking the build: `npx next build`. Confirm globals.css contains `scroll-margin-top` rule.
  </verify>
  <done>
The `about` export in `src/data/index.ts` contains `availability.status`, `availability.message`, `location.city`, `location.country`, `location.timezone`, and an enhanced bio. The `globals.css` file contains a `section[id] { scroll-margin-top: 6rem; }` rule inside `@layer base`. TypeScript compiles cleanly.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enhance About component with availability badge, location, and timezone</name>
  <files>src/components/home/About.tsx</files>
  <action>
Enhance `src/components/home/About.tsx` to display the new data from the about object. The component already imports `{ about } from '@/data'` and uses Framer Motion.

Add these new imports from lucide-react: `MapPin`, `Clock`. Do NOT remove existing imports.

Add a new content block between the bio and the experience section. This block should display:

1. **Availability badge**: A small green pulsing dot (using Tailwind's `animate-ping` pattern for the outer ring, solid inner dot) followed by the `about.availability.message` text. Use green-400/green-500 for the dot colors. The dot must be paired with text to satisfy WCAG 1.4.1 (no color-only indicators).

2. **Location**: A MapPin icon (w-3.5 h-3.5, text-primary) followed by `about.location.city, about.location.country`.

3. **Timezone**: A Clock icon (w-3.5 h-3.5, text-primary) followed by `about.location.timezone`.

Layout: Use a `flex flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-3` container for these three items so they wrap nicely on mobile. Each item uses `inline-flex items-center gap-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground`.

Wrap this new block in a `motion.div` following the existing animation pattern:
```
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 40 }}
whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
viewport={{ once: true }}
transition={{ duration: 0.8, delay: 0.1 }}
```

Keep the existing bio, experience, and skills sections intact. Only ADD the availability/location block between bio and experience. Adjust delay values on subsequent sections if needed (experience delay: 0.3, skills delay: 0.5) to maintain staggered reveal.

Do NOT change the section structure, id, or className. Do NOT remove the existing Framer Motion animations. Follow the existing Tailwind utility class patterns (oklch color tokens via semantic classes like text-primary, text-muted-foreground).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx next build` to confirm static export builds successfully. Visually inspect by running `npx next dev` and navigating to `http://localhost:3000/#about` -- the About section should show: bio text, then availability/location/timezone row, then experience, then skills. The green availability dot should pulse. Clicking navbar links should scroll to sections with proper offset (not hidden behind navbar).
  </verify>
  <done>
About section renders: (1) enhanced professional bio, (2) availability badge with pulsing green dot + "Available for freelance projects" text, (3) Belfast, Northern Ireland location with MapPin icon, (4) GMT/BST timezone with Clock icon. All new elements use Framer Motion whileInView animations consistent with existing patterns. Build succeeds. Scroll offset works correctly for all section anchors.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. `npx next build` succeeds without errors
2. About section displays bio, availability status, location, and timezone
3. Green dot availability indicator has accompanying text (WCAG 1.4.1)
4. Clicking #about, #work, #contact from navbar scrolls to correct position (not hidden behind navbar)
5. Mobile responsiveness: availability/location items wrap correctly at narrow widths
6. Existing experience and skills sections remain unchanged

<success_criteria>
- CONT-01 (partial): About section displays professional bio (photo addressed by existing Hero)
- CONT-02: Availability status visible with green indicator + text
- CONT-03: Belfast location and GMT/BST timezone displayed
- CONT-05 (partial): scroll-margin-top enables smooth navigation without navbar overlap
- Build passes, no TypeScript errors
</success_criteria>
