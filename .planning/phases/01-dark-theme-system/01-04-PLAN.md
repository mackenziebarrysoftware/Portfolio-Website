<objective>
Human verification of visual appearance, theme switching functionality, and interactive polish across both themes.

Purpose: Visual design and subjective polish require human judgment. Verify that dark/techy aesthetic meets freelancing client expectations and accessibility is perceptually sound, not just mathematically compliant.

Output: User approval or feedback for refinements before marking phase complete.

  <what-built>
Dark theme system with:
- Professional dark/techy color palette (soft black background, blue/cyan accents)
- User-controlled theme toggle in navbar
- Semantic color tokens enabling automatic theme switching
- WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios (documented in src/lib/theme-utils.ts)
- Polished hover states on buttons and interactive elements
- Enhanced typography for dark mode readability
- FOUC prevention via next-themes
  </what-built>

## Visual Testing

Start dev server if not already running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and test the following:

### Dark Theme (Default)
1. **Overall Aesthetic**
   - Does the dark theme look professional and signal technical skill?
   - Is the soft black background (#0a0a0a equivalent) comfortable to view? (not too harsh)
   - Do the blue/cyan accents feel appropriate for a tech portfolio?

2. **Readability**
   - Is all body text crisp and readable?
   - Are headings clearly distinguishable from body text?
   - Does typography feel balanced (not too thin or too heavy)?

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Hover over buttons - do they have smooth, polished transitions?
   - Tab through interactive elements with keyboard - are focus rings clearly visible?
   - Do cards have subtle hover effects (if applicable)?

### Light Theme
4. **Theme Toggle**
   - Click the theme toggle button in the navbar (Sun/Moon icon)
   - Does the theme switch immediately without any flash or flicker?
   - Is the light theme readable with good contrast?
   - Click toggle again to return to dark - smooth transition?

5. **Persistence**
   - Refresh the page (F5) - does your theme preference persist?
   - Open DevTools -> Application -> Local Storage -> Check for 'theme' key

### Cross-Component Testing
6. **Navigation**
   - All navbar elements visible in both themes?
   - Footer content readable in both themes?

7. **Content Sections**
   - Hero section text stands out appropriately?
   - Project cards (if visible) have good contrast?
   - About section readable?
   - Contact form inputs visible with proper borders?

### Mobile Testing (Optional but Recommended)
8. Open DevTools responsive mode (Ctrl+Shift+M)
   - Test theme toggle on mobile viewport
   - Verify readability at smaller sizes
   - Check that hover states work on touch devices

## Success Indicators
- ✅ Dark theme looks professional and "techy"
- ✅ Light theme is readable alternative
- ✅ Theme switching is instant and smooth
- ✅ No text is hard to read in either theme
- ✅ Hover states provide clear visual feedback
- ✅ Focus rings visible when navigating with keyboard
- ✅ Theme preference persists across page reloads

## Common Issues to Check
- ❌ Pure black (#000000) backgrounds - should be soft black
- ❌ Low contrast text that's hard to read
- ❌ Invisible or barely visible focus indicators
- ❌ Jarring color transitions when switching themes
- ❌ Theme toggle not visible in navbar
- ❌ Page flashes light theme before switching to dark on load (FOUC)

  <resume-signal>
Reply with:
- **"approved"** if everything looks good and phase is ready to mark complete
- **Describe specific issues** if refinements are needed (e.g., "primary button contrast too low in light theme", "hover effect on cards too subtle", "theme toggle icon hard to find")
  </resume-signal>

Human feedback determines success. No automated checks for this plan.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User explicitly approves visual appearance of dark theme
- User explicitly approves visual appearance of light theme
- User confirms theme switching works smoothly
- User confirms interactive elements have polished hover states
- User confirms no readability issues in either theme
- User confirms theme preference persists correctly
</success_criteria>

<output>
After user approval, create `.planning/phases/01-dark-theme-system/01-04-SUMMARY.md` documenting:
- User feedback (approved or issues identified)
- Any refinements made based on feedback
- Screenshots or visual notes if applicable
- Confirmation that phase success criteria are met
</output>
