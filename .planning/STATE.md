## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Dark/techy aesthetic over editorial — needs to signal technical skill for freelancing clients
- Data file for projects over CMS — simpler, no extra infrastructure
- Static export stays — already configured, fast hosting, no server costs

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- Phase 1 requires WCAG contrast validation before proceeding — poor contrast is expensive to fix later
- Phase 4 may need real content testing — templates without content can hide UX issues
- Phase 6 animations risk performance degradation — test with throttled CPU throughout
